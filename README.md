### Overview
In an e-commerce site, a retailer or a customer chooses different products to place the order. For that, he needs to add the products to his cart. So, cart plays a very important role for placing the order in the e-commerce sites. We have tried to make the process of adding the item to cart an easier one so that the customer doesnâ€™t find any difficulties or complexities in adding the item to the cart. The product will be added to the cart only when the credential of the retailer is correct.


### Prerequisite 
User must be logged in as retailer to perform the add item to cart functionality. He/she has to give his/her correct credential to add the item into the cart.
